# dashc, client emulator for DASH video streaming

## Description

dashc is an emulator of the video player, it is intended to be used as a test tool. The original goal was to have a lightweight test tool for network performance experiments with a real DASH video streaming traffic.

dashc has several options which can be changed through the command line arguments:

* video adaptation algorithm (Conventional, BBA-0/BBA-1/BBA-2, ARBITER);
* initial buffer size (in segments);
* last segment index for play;
* log file and folder name (the log file can be on/off);
* maximum buffer size (in seconds);
* persistent connection (on/off);
* generation of the meta information for BBA-2 and ARBITER (file with segment sizes);

## Installation

dashc had been used in Ubuntu 16.04/16.10/17.04/17.10/18.04 with x64 architecture (continuously for an ~1 year), in Ubuntu 16.04.3 with Raspberry Pi 2/3 (briefly), in macOS High Sierra 10.13 (briefly).

To install (./configure might ask for a sudo password to install opam, m4, git and bubblewrap (for Linux only)):

```bash
./configure
make
```

During ./configure, some questions might be asked:

Q: ## Where should it be installed ? [/usr/local/bin]

A: Accept it.

Q: Do you want opam to modify ~/.profile? [N/y/f]

A: y

Q: A hook can be added to opam's init scripts to ensure that the shell remains in sync with the opam environment when they are loaded. Set that up? [y/N]

A: y

To run tests (not necessary):

```bash
make test
```

## Usage

dashc can be run as simple as:

```bash
./dashc.exe play http://10.0.0.1/bbb.mpd
```

or:

```bash
./dashc.exe play http://10.0.0.1/bbb.mpd [-adapt conv] [-initb 2] [-maxbuf 60] [-persist true] [-turnlogon true] [-logname now] [-subfolder qwe]
```

Where all flags except the link to the MPD file are optional. Possible flags are:

* [-adapt], adaptation algorithm (conv; bba-0; bba-1; bba-2; arbiter);
* [-initb], initial buffer (in segments);
* [-lastsegmindex], last segment index for play;
* [-logname], name of the log file ("now" means usage of the current time stamp and it is used by default);
* [-maxbuf], maximum buffer size (in seconds);
* [-persist], persistent connection (true/false);
* [-segmentlist], this parameter is used to tell where to get meta data infromation (segment sizes, for example, for BBA-2 and ARBITER). Possible options are head (dashc will send head requests before starting to stream), local (file with segment size should be at the same folder with dashc), remote (file with segment size should be at the same location where target MPD file is stored) get segment sizes from  local - local segmentlist_%mpd_name%.txt file. The default option is head;
* [-subfolder], subfolder for the file;
* [-turnlogon], turn on logging to file;
* [-gensegmfile], generate segmentlist_%mpd_name%.txt file only (it will be rewritten if exists);
* [-help],  print this help text and exit, (alias: -?);

The detailed help can be found by running it with the -help flag:

```bash
./dashc.exe play -help
```

The typical log file will look like the example below (here the data only for the first 30 segments is shown, ARBITER adaptation algorithm is used, bbb-264 4 seconds segment size clip is used):

```bash

The columns include next information:

* segment number starting from 1;
* arrival time of a segment in milliseconds;
* time spent for delivery of this segment in milliseconds;
* stall (freeze) duration in milliseconds;
* representation rate of downloaded segment in Kbit/s (taken from MPD file);
* delivery rate of the network in Kbit/s (segment size divided by time for delivery);
* the actual bitrate of this segment (segment size divided by the segment duration) in Kbit/s;
* segment size in bytes;
* buffer level after this segment was just downloaded, in seconds;

## Dataset

The tool was tested with this dataset https://www.ucc.ie/en/misl/research/datasets/ivid_dataset/. The example of the log file above was taken with the Big Buck Bunny movie 4 second segment size x264 video codec and caddy web server (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddy_(web_server)>).

## Support

If you have an issue, please create a new one in github with necessary information (type of MPD file, OS version and etc.).

## FAQ

Q: I have opam 1.2.2 already, do I really need to install opam 2.0.0?

A: Yes, read the <https://opam.ocaml.org/blog/opam-2-0-0-repo-upgrade-roadmap/>.

Q: X package (dependency) cannot be installed.

A: Update of the packages database might help.

```bash
opam update          # Update the packages database
opam upgrade         # Bring everything to the latest version possible
```

Q: After the first ./configure, the make prints something like:

```bash
make: jbuilder: Command not found
Makefile:4: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 127
```

A: Log out of the OS and log in back might help.

Q: Why there was a need in a new implementation instead of updating already existing similar solutions?

A: It was clear that the new implementation won't take much time.

Q: Why OCaml was used (not a C/C++/Java/C#/Python)?

A: OCaml allowed to make a working tool in several days due to hands-on expirience with it.

Q: What is OCaml?

A: A good set of resources can be found here:
* <https://ocaml.org/learn/>
* <https://github.com/rizo/awesome-ocaml>
* <https://github.com/vramana/awesome-reasonml>
* <https://dev.realworldocaml.org/>
* <http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110>
* <http://alan.petitepomme.net/cwn/> (OCaml weekly news)
* <https://discuss.ocaml.org/>
* Some videos about OCaml (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1CmGbOGb2I>, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J8YyfrSwTk>, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnBPECrSC7o>)

Q: Are there any good IDEs for OCaml?

A: Visual Studio Code with reasonml plugin  (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=freebroccolo.reasonml>) is good. Merlin and ocp-indent should be installed as well:
```bash
opam install merlin ocp-indent
```

Q: Are there any open source code examples in OCaml?

A: Some open source projects:
* <https://github.com/tezos>
* <http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/archive/tournaments.html>
* <https://github.com/facebook/infer>
